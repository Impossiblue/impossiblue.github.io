	<h1>SOURDOUGH&#8194;STARTER</h1>

	<div id="recipe">

		<p><i>I appreciate that for many, the biggest obstacle to baking bread at home is time. So to counter this, I have developed a recipe designed to fit around busy lives. Something that can be done by all and which requires no fancy equipment. So, no matter how crappy your oven is, everyone can bake great bread at home.</i> (<a href="https://thefirehouse.ie" target="_blank">P. Ryan</a>)</p><p>This starter can be used for both the <a href="bread-1.html"><i>&#8220;White&#8221; sourdough bread</i></a> and the darker <a href="bread-2.html"><i>Rye sourdough bread</i></a>.</p>

		<h3>DAY&#8194;1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>50g wholemeal flour</li>
			<li>50g water</li>
			<li>Place the flour and water into a clean bowl and stir together until fully combined. <span class="nb">NOTE: </span>The bowl should be big enough to hold a final 600g starter mixture and space for rising</li>
			<li>Cover with a cloth (not airtight!) and leave at room temperature overnight</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>DAY&#8194;2</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Add 50g wholemeal flour</li>
			<li>Add 50g water</li>
			<li>Stir together until fully combined</li>
			<li>Cover once more and leave at room temperature overnight</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>DAY&#8194;3</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Discard 100g of sourdough starter. To the remainder&#8230;</li>
			<li>Add 100g wholemeal flour</li>
			<li>Add 100g water</li>
			<li>Stir together until fully combined</li>
			<li>Cover and leave at room temperature overnight</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>DAY&#8194;4</h3>
		<p>At this point, the starter should start to smell pleastantly sour with small bubbles appearing on the surface.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Discard 150g of sourdough starter. To the remainder&#8230;</li>
			<li>Add 100g wholemeal flour</li>
			<li>Add 100g water</li>
			<li>Stir together until fully combined</li>
			<li>Cover and leave at room temperature overnight</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>DAY&#8194;5</h3>
		<p>The starter should appear active and full of bubbles.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Discard 200g of sourdough starter. To the remainder&#8230;</li>
			<li>Add 150g wholemeal flour</li>
			<li>Add 150g water</li>
			<li>Stir together until fully combined</li>
			<li>Cover and leave at room temperature overnight</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>DAY&#8194;6</h3>
		<p>By now, the starter should be quite active; full of little bubbles and smell slightly sour.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Discard 250g of sourdough starter. To the remainder&#8230;</li>
			<li>Add 200g wholemeal flour</li>
			<li>Add 200g water</li>
			<li>Stir together until fully combined</li>
			<li>Cover and leave at room temperature overnight</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>DAY&#8194;7&#8230;ISH</h3>

		<p><i>The starter should now be very active and full of bubbles; ready to use.</i></p>

		<p><span class="nb">NOTE: </span>Yes, there are seven days to a week, but a sour&shy;dough is ignorant of that. Depending on the environment (like ambient temperature and amount of bacteria in the air), it may take a little longer to mature. If so, keep going and check out the referenced video for visual assistance.</p>

		<h2>MAINTAINING&#8194;A&#8194;STARTER</h2>

		<p>When making sourdough bread always retain some sourdough starter to feed and refresh, ensuring some sourdough starter for the next dough. Bakers have kept their starters alive for years and years and years.</p><p>The only reason bakers discard some of the starter is to prevent ending up with too much. The more starter there is, the more it has to be fed. For a home baker, only small amounts are required. Remember, however, that whenever the recipe states that some starter should be discarded, feel free to use this &#8220;waste&#8221; creatively. Think pancakes, waffles&#8230;</p><p>To refresh or feed a sourdough starter, whatever weight of starter, add the same weight of flour and the same weight of water. Stir everything together. If the sourdough starter is stored at room temperature it will require feeding every day. For the home baker who bakes only once a week, having to feed/refresh a sourdough starter every day can become quite expensive. A starter <em>can</em> be stored (e.g. in a sealed glass vessel) in the fridge for up to 10 days and taken out when needed. Feeding every 7 days would probably be preferable though, and it also sets the stage for an easy-to-remember routine.</p><p>The starter can actually be frozen. Upon thawing and subsequent feeding for 2 or 3 days, it is good to go.</p><p>If a starter should show the signs of old age (the absence of that pleasant sour smell and a build-up of milky liquid on its top) drain the liquid off and follow the refresh-description above.</p><p><span class="nb">NOTE: </span>Say, if baking is set for Saturday morning, remove the starter from the fridge Friday morning and leave it at room temperature until that evening. Then take out as much starter as necessary, add the same amount of flour and the same amount of water, mix, and leave the new starter covered with a cloth, at room temperature, until baking day. (The remainder of the original starter should either be fed or it should go back into the fridge once &#8220;stolen&#8221; from.)</p>
