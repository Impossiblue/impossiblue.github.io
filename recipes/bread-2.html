	<h1>RYE&#8194;SOURDOUG&#8194;BREAD</h1>

	<div id="recipe">

		<p>This recipe makes 1 bread. Although it is based on a rye sourdough starter it <em>may</em> use a <a href="sourdough.html">&#8220;white&#8221; sourdough starter</a> if one does not wish to have two different starters going. To <em>make</em> a rye sourdough, follow the exact same procedure as with the white starter</a>, only swap out the white flour for rye flour.</p>

		<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>500g rye flour</li>
			<li>10g sea salt</li>
			<li>360g water</li>
			<li>350g rye sourdough starter</li>
			<li>Olive oil (for greasing)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bowl (for the dough)</li>
			<li>2.5l/3.0l round Pyrex vessel with lid</li>
			<li>Grill mesh baking tray</li>
			<li>Optional: Dough scraper (a piece of plastic, really)</li>
			<li>Optional: Sieve (to sprinkle flour)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This recipe has been tested with an oven with heating coils located both in the bottom and in the top. Assuming more or less equal temperature within the oven, the baking tray is slided onto the pair of rails that centre the baking vessel vertically.</p>

		<h3>PREPARATION</h3>
		<p>The sourdough starter should be fed the day before baking so that it&#8217;s active, bubbling and rising in its container on baking day.</p>

		<h3>BAKING&#8194;DAY</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the rye flour to a clean mixing bowl. Distribute the salt through the flour. Add the water and sourdough starter to the flour. Combine all the ingredients to form a rough dough.</li>
			<li>Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface. When starting out, the dough for this bread will look like a big paste &#8211; a mess &#8211; and the normal kneading technique needs to be adjusted. For instance, the amount of kneading should be reduced simply because the small amount of gluten in the rye will not be enough to make a round, elastic dough. Stretch out, work in, using only the fingertips &#8211; and resist the temptation to add more flour. Do this for a couple of minutes. <span class="nb">TIP: </span>Use a dough scraper to easily help keep the dough together.</li>
			<li>Shape the dough into a rough ball and return the dough to the mixing bowl. <span class="nb">TIP: </span>To reduce the stickiness of the dough to help remove it later, add some olive oil to the baking bowl as well as to the working hands making the ball.</li>
			<li>Cover with a tea towel and allow the dough to prove for approximately 2&frac12; hours at room temperature.</li>
			<li>While waiting, line the Pyrex bowl with the tea towel and flour-dust the towel.</li>
			<li>After 2&frac12; hours turn the dough onto a work surface lightly sprinkled with rye flour and knock the dough back. <span class="nb">NOTE: </span>Again, this dough will feel very different when knocked back. It will crack and break, so it can only be reshaped into a rough, round shape.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle some flour on its top and place the shaped dough upside down into the bowl. <span class="nb">NOTE: </span>The reason for using a bowl is that it acts like a proving basket. The shape of the bowl encourages the dough to take on the bowl&#8217;s shape and to prove up and not just to spread out flat.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle some more flour over the dough. Tuck in the towel, put on the Pyrex lid and leave to prove once more, this time for about 2 hours at room temperature. <span class="nb">TIP: </span>Sourdough normally benefits from proving over longer periods in a fridge, but rye sourdoughs tend to give better results when baked on the same day.</li>
			<li>After the second proving, slide the baking tray into the oven, on the pair of rails that will position the vessel vertically centered in the oven. <span class="nb">NOTE: </span>If the oven has heating elements only in the bottom, place the tray in the bottom and consider using the oven fan (if it has one).</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 230&#176;C.</li>
			<li>While waiting for the oven, remove the lid from the Pyrex vessel. (At this time the dough should have risen somewhat and started to crack ever so slightly.) Turn the lid over and (optionally) grease and dust its inside; this will prevent the dough from sticking to it later. Now, lift the corners of the towel and let them hang over the side of the bowl (this reveals the dough). Put the lids back on and flip the Pyrex vessel over. Remove the bowl and (gently) the towel. The dough now rests on the lid.</li>
			<li>For aesthetic reasons, sprinkle some rye flour on the dough.</li>
			<li>Return the bowl (upside down) on its lid. <span class="nb">NOTE: </span>Normally this bread would be baked uncovered in the oven and with steam added. The closed Pyrex vessel will however act as a tiny steam environment courtesy of the water evaporating from the dough when it is heated up. The reason for steam, by the way, is to allow the dough to keep its elasticity longer before a crust is generated; preventing large cracks in the surface of the final bread.</li>
			<li>Leave the dough to sit for about 5 minutes so that it spreads slightly and cracks start to appear on the surface. This is a classic characteristic of rye sourdoughs.</li>
			<li>Place the vessel on the tray in the oven.</li>
			<li>Close the oven door.</li>
			<li>Set a kitchen timer for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Remove the bowl when this time has elapsed and continue baking without the bowl. Set a kitchen timer for an additional 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>When <em>this</em> time is up, inspect the bread (both its aestetics, its crust and the sound when tapped). If it is not quite there, allow it bake more or just shut the oven off and leave the bread on &#8220;afterburner&#8221;. <span class="nb">NOTE: </span>A pure rye bread will never make a big jump in the oven, but it will rise and spread slightly which creates a very close textured bread.</li>
			<li>Remove from oven and leave to cool.</li>

		<h2>GOOD&#8194;TO&#8194;KNOW</h2>

		<p>Rye is <em>not</em> gluten free, but it is very low on gluten. Even so, a rye starter is a little bit more active than a &#8220;white&#8221; flour starter.</p><p>Rye breads can be quite heavy, but packful of flavour. They also tend to be quite gummy, both in texture and in taste.</p><p>The salt in the recipe is in there to season the taste, heightening the flavour. Whatever the preference, feel free to go lower on the salt or add marginally more.</p><p>Because of the nature of rye flour, sometimes once baked the bread can feel a bit gummy, so it may benefit from sitting or ripening for a day before cutting. This makes it ideal for baking in the evening and then leaving to sit overnight before eating.</p>
