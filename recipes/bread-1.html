	<h1 class="hp">&#8220;WHITE&#8221; SOURDOUGH&#8194;BREAD</h1>

	<div id="recipe">

		<p>This recipe is based on the <a href="sourdough.html"><i>Sourdough starter</i></a> and makes 2 loaves.</p>

		<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>800g strong white flour</li>
			<li>10g sea salt</li>
			<li>460g lukewarm water</li>
			<li>320g &#8220;white&#8221; sourdough starter</li>
			<li>Optional: Olive oil (for greasing)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bowl (for the dough)</li>
			<li>2 x 2.5l/3.0l round Pyrex vessel with lid</li>
			<li>Grill mesh baking tray</li>
			<li>Razor blade (for the baker&#8217;s signature)</li>
			<li>Optional: Dough scraper (a piece of plastic, really)</li>
			<li>Optional: Sieve (to sprinkle flour)</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="nb">NOTE: </span>This recipe has been tested with an oven with heating coils located both in the bottom and in the top. Assuming more or less equal temperature within the oven, the baking tray is slided onto the pair of rails that centre the baking vessels vertically.</p>

		<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the flour to a clean mixing bowl. Mix the salt through the flour. Add the water and sourdough starter to the flour.</li>
			<li>Combine all the ingredients to form a rough dough.</li>
			<li>Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface. Knead the dough for (maybe) 10 minutes (it depends on the baker and the dough, really &#8211; take a look at the accompanying video for a visualization of the proper elasticity of the dough). When kneading, do not worry if the dough is slightly wet or sticky. Resist the temptation to add extra flour. Return the dough to the mixing bowl, cover with a tea towel, and leave to prove for 3 hours at room temperature.</li>
			<li>While waiting, line the Pyrex vessels with clean tea towels and dust with flour. These will later be used as proving &#8220;baskets&#8221;, the main purpose of which is to let the dough for each loaf prove upwards (into a shape) and not spread out (flat on the table). The flour powder will prevent the dough from sticking to the surface.</li>
			<li>After 3 hours, knock the dough back on a clean surface and make it into a ball. This pushes air from the dough and equalizes the temperature within. Visually, the dough will look as it did 3 hours ago.</li>
			<li>To shape the dough for a pair of loaves, cut it in 2 halves, form each into a ball and put them, seam side facing up, gently into their own Pyrex bowl. <span class="nb">NOTE: </span>If the bowls are of different volumes, cut the dough accordingly.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle some flour on top of the doughs. Tuck each of them gently inside their towel and put their lids on.</li>
			<li>Set the baskets aside and let the doughs prove for another 3 to 3&frac12; hours at room temperature. <span class="nb">NOTE: </span>The great thing about this recipe is that, at this stage (if the day is coming to an end), the doughs can sit in the fridge overnight, no harm done.</li>
			<li>After this second proving the dough surfaces should have a slight bounce to them. If not (i.e. if they feel like they will collapse any moment), they have been caught too late in the process. Make a mental note of this and next time baking, adjust the proving time to catch the doughs on the rise.</li>
			<li>Bounce alright? The doughs are ready to bake (i.e. immediately; no waiting for the doughs to reach room temperature if chilled). To conserve energy, plan to bake both breads at the same time.</li>
			<li>Slide the baking tray into the oven, on the pair of rails that will position the vessels vertically centered in the oven.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 230&#176;C.</li>
			<li>While waiting for the oven, remove the lids from the Pyrex vessels. Turn the lids over and (optionally) grease and dust their insides; this will prevent the dough from sticking to them later. Now, lift the corners of each tea towel and let them hang over the side of their Pyrex bowl (this reveals the dough). Put the lids back on and flip each Pyrex vessel over. Remove the bowls and (gently) the towels. The doughs now rests on the lids.</li>
			<li>Using a sharp knife or a razor blade, cut the surfaces of the doughs. (This is what is known as <i>the baker&#8217;s signature</i>.) The doughs can be cut up to &frac12;cm deep.</li>
			<li>For aesthetic reasons, consider sprinkling the doughs with some extra flour.</li>
			<li>Cover each dough/lid with its Pyrex bowl (upside down).</li>
			<li>Place the two vessels on the tray in the oven.</li>
			<li>Close the oven door.</li>
			<li>Set a kitchen timer for 25 minutes.</li>
			<li>After 25 minutes, take the Pyrex vessels out, lift off their bowls and reinsert the lids/doughs.</li>
			<li>Set the timer for an additional 25 minutes and continue baking. Now, in the absence of steam, a good crust should form.</li>
			<li>After the total of 50 minutes, take each bread/lid out of the oven and remove the lids from underneath the breads. Tap the base of each bread. If the sound is hollow, the bread is finished. If not, allow the bread(s), without lid(s), additional time in the oven.</li>
			<li>Finally, turn the oven off, slide the tray out and allow the breads to cool down on the tray.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="nb">NOTE: </span>The temptation is always there to slice the newly baked bread for an immediate taste. Remember though: The flavour can and will improve if the bread is left to itself for some time.</p>

		<h2>GOOD TO KNOW</h2>
		
		<p>Using a fridge for the second proving reduces the temperature of the dough allowing it to prove slower and longer which in turn improves the development of flavour within the dough and increases its digestibility.</p><p>Also, as dough ferments or proves, the gluten within the dough breaks down.</p><p>By baking the dough in a Pyrex vessel there is no need to steam the oven. Baking in a closed environment creates its own steam which will allow the dough to rise and open up while baking. The surface keeps its elasticity longer and has less tendency to crack. This method is very similar to the old style of Dutch oven baking.</p>
